## Problems and How I Solved Them

### 1. **Putting Things in the Right Place**  
- **Problem**: It was hard to center, cards, and text.  
- **Solution**: Used Flexbox and Bootstrap tools like d-flex, justify-content-center, and align-items-center to center things correctly.

### 2. **Keeping the Style the Same**  
- **Problem**: Needed the same colors, fonts, and spacing on every page.  
- **Solution**: Used CSS variables to set main colors and font sizes in one place. This made it easier to keep the design the same.

### 3. **Making It Work on All Devices**  
- **Problem**: I needed the site to look good on phones and tablet. I couldn't figure out how i would target the hero image to appear in the mobile view.
- **Solution**: There was no solution to this.

### 4. **FAQ Accordion**  
- **Problem**:I Needed to add a dropdown (accordion) for the FAQ section.  
- **Solution**: So i used Bootstrapâ€™s built-in accordion and changed its look with CSS.
